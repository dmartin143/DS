# Database Project


## Running the Application

Make sure you have Nodejs and MySQL installed on your device.

Make sure to add a file to the directory "backend/src" named configDB.json.
Inside this file you must have a JSON containing MySQL setup info as follows
{
    "host": "TBD",
    "user": "TBD",
    "password": "TBD",
    "database": "TBD",
    "connectionLimit": TBD
}

Steps to prepare the application:

1. Move to the directory "backend/src" (can be done via cd command)
2. Type in the command "npm install"
3. Type the command "npm start". Now the backend should be up and running.
4. Move to the directory "frontend/ucf_events" (can be done via cd command)
5. Type in the command "npm install"
6. Type the command "npm start". Now the frontend should be up and running.

The website should then be usable and will open up on your browser.
